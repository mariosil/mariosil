- 👋 Hi, I’m **Mario Silveira** (@mariosil)
- 👀 I’m interested in web development mainly in backend technologies, primarily with **_Ruby on Rails_** 🚂💎. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning _React JS_ with no pressure at all, because it's cool, and because try to be a flexible developer it's cool too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to make a difference in people's lives and that also allow me to buy tacos 🌮 ...lots of tacos. Because I love tacos and my family also need tacos to survive.
- 📫 How to reach me ...you can send me an email to silveira.mario.lab@gmail.com.
